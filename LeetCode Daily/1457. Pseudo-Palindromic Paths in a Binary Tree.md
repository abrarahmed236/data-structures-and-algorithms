# [1457. Pseudo-Palindromic Paths in a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/pseudo-palindromic-paths-in-a-binary-tree/description/)

We traverse the tree while remembering the root to leaf path.  
When we reach a leaf node, we need to check if the current path is a
pseudopalindrome.  
We do this by counting the number of times each element is seen in the path.  
In a path of odd length, there should be exactly 1 number that appeared odd
number of times.  
In a path of even length, there should be exactly 0 numbers that have appeared
an odd number of times.  
Now in a path of even length, the number of odd counted elements possible is
even, i.e (0, 2, 4 ...)  
So in total, we can see this as the total number of odd counted elements should
be <=1 without loss of generality.  
After doing this for each leaf node, we have the result we want.

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
   public:
    int pseudoPalindromicPaths(TreeNode *root) {
        vector<int> table(10, 0);
        return getPaths(root, table);
    }

   private:
    int getPaths(TreeNode *root, vector<int> &table) {
        if (!root)
            return 0;

        table[root->val]++;
        int result = getPaths(root->left, table) + getPaths(root->right, table);

        if (!root->left && !root->right) {
            int oddCount = 0;
            for (int i : table) {
                if (i % 2 == 1) {
                    oddCount++;
                }
            }
            result += (oddCount <= 1) ? 1 : 0;
        }

        table[root->val]--;
        return result;
    }
};
```
