# [1481. Least Number of Unique Integers after K Removals](https://leetcode.com/problems/least-number-of-unique-integers-after-k-removals/description/)

## Approach

First sort the array of numbers. After sorting, all duplicates are adjacent to
each other. Use this to construct an array of counter structs. Each counter
struct contains the number it is counting and the count of that number. Now sort
the counter array by the count. Remove the least frequent elements with a total
of `k` removals allowed.

## Complexity

- Time: `O(Nlog(N))`
- Space: `O(N)`

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
    typedef struct {
        int num;
        int count;
    } Counter;

   public:
    int findLeastNumOfUniqueInts(vector<int> &arr, int k) {
        // Let us sort the array to bring together all duplicates. After
        // sorting, all duplicates are adjacent to each other
        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());

        // Use the property of all duplicates being adjacent to each other to
        // easily count the number of times each number occurs
        vector<Counter> counters;
        counters.push_back({arr[0], 1});
        for (int i = 1; i < arr.size(); i++) {
            if (arr[i] == counters.back().num)
                counters.back().count++;
            else
                counters.push_back({arr[i], 1});
        }

        // Sort the counters by their count
        sort(counters.begin(), counters.end(),
             [](const Counter &c1, const Counter &c2) {
                 return c1.count < c2.count;
             });

        // Starting from the least frequently occuring element, see if all
        // occurences of that element can be removed within k total removals, if
        // yes, then  decrement k (k -= counters[i].count) and disregard all
        // occurences of that element (i++), if no, then all elements before the
        // current element can be disregarded.
        int i = 0;
        while (i < counters.size() && counters[i].count <= k)
            k -= counters[i++].count;
        return counters.size() - i;
    }
};
```
