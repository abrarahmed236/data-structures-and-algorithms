# [1074. Number of Submatrices That Sum to Target](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-submatrices-that-sum-to-target/description/)

We have O(N^4) submatrices, each of which can take O(N^2) to naively calculate
giving us a time of O(N^6), we can make this better by making the calculation of
each submatrix a constant time operation.

If we calculate a prematrix where the value in the current cell is equal to the
total sum of all values defined by the submatrix [0, 0] -> [i, j], then we can
calculate any given submatrix [i1, j1] -> [i2, j2] in constant time.

Example: say we want the total sum of the submatrix defined by [3, 2] -> [4, 4],
then we do the following.

|     | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| 1   |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| 2   |     | D   |     |     | C   |     |
| 3   |     |     | \_  | \_  | \_  |     |
| 4   |     | B   | \_  | \_  | A   |     |
| 5   |     |     |     |     |     |     |

```txt
A = matrix[i2  , j2  ] = matrix[4, 4];
B = matrix[i2  , j1-1] = matrix[4, 1];
C = matrix[i1-1, j2  ] = matrix[3, 4];
D = matrix[i1-1, j1-1] = matrix[3, 1];
sum = A + D - B - C;
```

Using this we can reduce the final complexity to O(N^4).

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
   public:
    int numSubmatrixSumTarget(vector<vector<int>> &matrix, int target) {
        int M = matrix.size() + 1;
        int N = matrix[0].size() + 1;
        vector<vector<int>> preMatrix(M, vector<int>(N, 0));

        for (int i = 1; i < M; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < N; j++) {
                preMatrix[i][j] = matrix[i - 1][j - 1] + preMatrix[i][j - 1] +
                                  preMatrix[i - 1][j] - preMatrix[i - 1][j - 1];
            }
        }

        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < M; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < N; j++) {
                for (int i1 = i; i1 < M; i1++) {
                    for (int j1 = j; j1 < N; j1++) {
                        int A = preMatrix[i1][j1];
                        int B = preMatrix[i1][j - 1];
                        int C = preMatrix[i - 1][j1];
                        int D = preMatrix[i - 1][j - 1];
                        if (A + D - B - C == target)
                            count++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
};
```
