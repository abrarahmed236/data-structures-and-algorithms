# [32. Longest Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-valid-parentheses/description/)

## Approach: Brute Force

We can try a brute force approach by finding the longest valid parenthesis from
each possible starting point in the string.

## Complexity: Brute Force

-   Time: `O(N^2)`
-   Space: `O(1)`

## Code: Brute Force

```cpp
class Solution {
   public:
    int longestValidParentheses(string s) {
        const int N = s.size();
        const char open = '(';
        const char close = ')';

        int max_len = 0;

        // Fix the starting point and find the longest parenthesis sequence that
        // includes the starting point. Do this for each starting point.
        for (int i = 0; i < N - 1; i++) {
            int open_count = 0;
            int curr_len = 0;

            for (int j = i; j < N; j++) {
                if (s[j] == open) {
                    // Open count indicates number of open parenthesis that are
                    // yet to be closed. This is an invalid sequence but can be
                    // made valid by close parenthesis further down the line.
                    open_count++;
                }
                if (s[j] == close) {
                    // If open_count < 0 then the sequence is now invalid and
                    // remains invalid no matter what we add afterwards.
                    if (open_count == 0)
                        break;

                    // Everytime we see a close bracket and there are open
                    // brackets remaining to close, close one of them increase
                    // valid length by two
                    open_count--;
                    curr_len += 2;

                    // We want to count the length of the sequence only if the
                    // open count is zero, which means that the sequence is
                    // perfectly verified to be valid.
                    if (open_count == 0) {
                        max_len = max(max_len, curr_len);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return max_len;
    }
};
```
