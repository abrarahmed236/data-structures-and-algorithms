# [2149. Rearrange Array Elements by Sign](https://leetcode.com/problems/rearrange-array-elements-by-sign/description/)

## Approach: Auxiliary Arrays

A very simple solution would be to copy over positive and negative numbers into separate vectors and then write back to the original vector in alternating order. Since we do not change the order of the positive numbers between each other, and the negative numbers between each other, we don't need to worry about their order changing in the final vector.

### Complexity: Auxiliary Arrays

- Time: `O(N)`
- Space: `O(N)`

### Code: Auxiliary Arrays

```cpp
class Solution {
   public:
    vector<int> rearrangeArray(vector<int> &nums) {
        int N = nums.size();
        vector<int> positive_arr, negative_arr;
        for (int &num : nums) {
            if (num < 0)
                negative_arr.push_back(num);
            else
                positive_arr.push_back(num);
        }
        nums.clear();
        for (int i = 0; i < positive_arr.size(); i++) {
            nums.push_back(positive_arr[i]);
            nums.push_back(negative_arr[i]);
        }
        return nums;
    }
};
```

## Approach: Write to Result

A very similar approach would be to write to a result vector directly indexing based on whether the currrent element is positive or negative.

### Complexity: Write to Result

- Time: `O(N)`
- Space: `O(N)`

### Code: Write to Result

```cpp
class Solution {
   public:
    vector<int> rearrangeArray(vector<int> &nums) {
        int N = nums.size();
        vector<int> result(N);
        int i = 0, j = 1;
        for (auto it = nums.begin(); it != nums.end(); it++) {
            if (*it > 0) {
                result[i] = *it;
                i += 2;
            } else {
                result[j] = *it;
                j += 2;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```
