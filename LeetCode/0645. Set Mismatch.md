# [645. Set Mismatch](https://leetcode.com/problems/set-mismatch/description/)

## Approach 1

For this solution we sort the array beforehand. And we do two different checks
for the missing number and the doubled number.

For the missing number, we have a variable that starts with `1` and it gets
incremented when we see the current value in the sorted array. This counter gets
stopped at the missing element and does not get incremented any further.

For the doubled number we check if the previous number is the same as the
current number. In a sorted array with one doubled number this gives us the
doubled number.

### Code for Approach 1

```cpp
class Solution {
   public:
    vector<int> findErrorNums(vector<int> &nums) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int missing = 1;
        int doubled = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            // count missing number
            if (nums[i] == missing) {
                missing++;
            }

            // count doubled number
            if (i && nums[i - 1] == nums[i]) {
                doubled = nums[i];
            }
        }
        return {doubled, missing};
    }
};
```

## Approach 2

For this solution, since we know that the constraints for how many elements
there are and the maximum value of an element to be below 1e4, we know that we
can simply count the number of elements using an array. If an element is as it
should be its `count == 1`, if it is the missing element its `count == 0`, and
if it is the doubled element, its `count == 2`. we use this information to
return the result.

### Code for Approach 2

```cpp
class Solution {
   public:
    vector<int> findErrorNums(vector<int> &nums) {
        vector<int> counter(nums.size());

        for (int i : nums) counter[i - 1]++;

        int missing = -1, doubled = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < counter.size(); i++) {
            if (counter[i] == 0)
                missing = i + 1;
            if (counter[i] == 2)
                doubled = i + 1;
            if (missing != -1 && doubled != -1)
                break;
        }

        return {doubled, missing};
    }
};
```
