We are asked to implement a Queue using two stacks.

> Note: Visually stack A grows to the left and stack B grows to the right.

What we can do is to push to stack A everytime we push, and while popping we
check if B is empty. If B is empty we pop every single element from A and push
it onto B and then pop from B. If B is not empty then we simply pop from B.

## Code

```cpp
class MyQueue {
    stack<int> A, B;

   public:
    MyQueue() {}

    void push(int x) { A.push(x); }

    int pop() {
        if (B.empty()) {
            while (A.size()) {
                B.push(A.top());
                A.pop();
            }
        }
        int result = B.top();
        B.pop();
        return result;
    }

    int peek() {
        if (B.empty()) {
            while (A.size()) {
                B.push(A.top());
                A.pop();
            }
        }
        return B.top();
    }

    bool empty() { return A.empty() && B.empty(); }
};
```
