# [739. Daily Temperatures](https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/description/)

## Naive Solution

The naive solution is to look for the next greater element for each element.

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
   public:
    vector<int> dailyTemperatures(vector<int> &temperatures) {
        int N = temperatures.size();
        vector<int> result(N, 0);

        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < N; j++) {
                if (temperatures[i] < temperatures[j]) {
                    result[i] = j - i;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

## Better Naive Solution

A better naive solution is to start from the back and remember the `max_element`
seen until now. If the current element is less than the `max_element` then we
search between the current element and the max element. This solution is also
`O(N^2)` and possibly not at all better than the previous solution but it gives
us a clue as to how to proceed.

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
   public:
    vector<int> dailyTemperatures(vector<int> &temperatures) {
        int N = temperatures.size();
        int max_temp = INT_MIN, max_idx;
        vector<int> result(N, 0);

        for (int i = N - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (temperatures[i] >= max_temp) {
                max_temp = temperatures[i];
                max_idx = i;
            } else {
                for (int j = i + 1; j <= max_idx; j++) {
                    if (temperatures[i] < temperatures[j]) {
                        result[i] = j - i;
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

## O(N) DP Solution

So, we have learned two things until now. One, that the rising segments are
trivially easy to solve, but the falling segments need a more detailed approach
to solve. Two, if we solve from the back, we can possibly use previously solved
rising segments and recently solved falling segments as part of solving the
current sub-problem.

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
   public:
    vector<int> dailyTemperatures(vector<int> &temperatures) {
        int N = temperatures.size();

        // Result Vector
        vector<int> result(N);

        // The last element is always zero since there is no greater element
        // after that.
        result.back() = 0;

        // Solve from the back and use the previously solved subproblems.
        for (int curr = N - 2; curr >= 0; curr--) {
            // Start looking for an element greater than the current from 1
            // element after the current.
            int next = curr + 1;

            // Continue jumping forward until you find an element that is
            // greater or you find an element that is not greater but has no
            // elements greater than itself after it (i.e., result[next] == 0).
            while (true) {
                if (temperatures[curr] < temperatures[next]) {
                    // Element at 'next' matches the criteria, so store the
                    // result for the current element and stop looking.
                    result[curr] = next - curr;
                    break;
                } else {
                    // Element at 'next' does not match the criteria. So check
                    // if we can jump further or not.
                    if (result[next] == 0) {
                        // If we can jump no further then the current element is
                        // the greatest seen from the back.
                        result[curr] = 0;
                        break;
                    } else {
                        // If we can jump further we can still keep looking for
                        // an element greater than the current.
                        next += result[next];
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```
