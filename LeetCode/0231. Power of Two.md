# [231. Power of Two](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-two/description/)

## Approach

Simply count the number of `on` bits. A number that is a power of two has
exactly one `on` bit.

## Complexity

-   Time: `O(1)`
-   Space: `O(1)`

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
   public:
    bool isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        if (n <= 0)
            return false;

        int count = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            count += n & 1;
            n >>= 1;
        }

        return count == 1;
    }
};
```
