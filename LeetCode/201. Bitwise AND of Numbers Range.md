# [201. Bitwise AND of Numbers Range](https://leetcode.com/problems/bitwise-and-of-numbers-range/description/)

### Description

Given two integers `left` and `right` that represent the range `[left, right]`,
return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.

### Constraints:

-   `0 <= left <= right <= 2^31 - 1`

## Approach: Iterate over range

In the first approach we can simply iterate from the left to right, with a
couple extra lines of code to avoid integer overflow since the constraints state
that `left` and `right` are `<= 2^31-1`. This approach has a time complexity
of`O(N)`. This is pretty bad because the worst case goes up to `INT_MAX`.

### Complexity: Iterate over range

-   Time: `O(N)`
-   Space: `O(1)`

### Code: Iterate over range

```cpp
class Solution {
   public:
    int rangeBitwiseAnd(int left, int right) {
        if (left == INT_MAX)
            return left;

        int result = left;
        for (int curr = left + 1; curr < right; curr++) result &= curr;
        result &= right;

        return result;
    }
};
```

## Approach: Bitwise properties

To do better than the `O(N)` approach we need to look at the bitwise properties
of the numbers in the range. To do this let us first look at a couple examples.

```txt
Example 1: left = 8 right 14
            _
left    8   1000
        9   1001
        10  1010
        11  1011
        12  1100
        13  1101
right   14  1110

Example 2: left = 12 right = 15
            __
left    12  1100
        13  1101
        14  1110
right   15  1111

Example 3: left = 10 right = 11
            ___
left    10  1010
right   11  1011
```

Looking at the examples we can see that the bitwise `and` of the range will
contain the common part in all of the numbers in the range. and all other bits
will be set to zero. We can get this common part by bitwise shifting both left
and right towards the right side until `left == right`. And if we remember the
number of times we shifted to the right, then shifting the common part to the
left the same number of times gives us the result we are looking for.

### Complexity: Bitwise Properties

-   Time: `O(1)`
-   Space: `O(1)`

### Code: Bitwise Properties

```cpp
class Solution {
   public:
    int rangeBitwiseAnd(int left, int right) {
        int count = 0;

        while (left != right) {
            left >>= 1;
            right >>= 1;
            count++;
        }

        return left << count;
    }
};
```
