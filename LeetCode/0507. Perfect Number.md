# [507. Perfect Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/perfect-number/description/)

A perfect number is a number that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors
excluding the number itself.

For each number we start from `2` and go up to `sqrt(num)` and check if we can
divide the number properly, if we can, then we add the divisors to the sum.

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
   public:
    bool checkPerfectNumber(int num) {
        if (num == 1)
            return false;
        int sum = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= sqrt(num); i++) {
            if (num % i == 0) {
                sum += i;
                sum += num / i;
            }
        }
        return sum == num;
    }
};
```
